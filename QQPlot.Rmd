## 1. Normal Distribution

### Make Normal Random Samples with Mean = 50 and Standard Deviation = 15

```{r}
weight = rnorm(58, 50, 15)
```

### Let's draw an Histogram of weight

```{r}
hist(weight)
```

### Let's draw a Q-Q Plot of it.

Q-Q Plot is Theoretical Percentile vs. Actual Percentile.

```{r}
qqnorm(weight)
qqline(weight)
```



## 2. Left Skewed Distribution


``` {r}
set.seed(5)
weight_skewed_left = sample(10:80, size = 58, replace = TRUE, prob = 80:10)
```

### Let's draw Histogram
``` {r}
hist(weight_skewed_left)
```

### Let's draw QQ Plot
``` {r}
qqnorm(weight_skewed_left)
qqline(weight_skewed_left)
```

## 3. Right Skewed Distribution

``` {r}
set.seed(8)
weight_skewed_right = sample(10:80, size = 58, replace = TRUE, prob = 10:80)
```


### Let's draw Histogram
``` {r}
hist(weight_skewed_right)
```


### Let's draw QQ Plot
``` {r}
qqnorm(weight_skewed_right)
qqline(weight_skewed_right)
```
